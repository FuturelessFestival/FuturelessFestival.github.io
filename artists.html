She is also a formal painter, using both brushes and paints as well as Machine Learning to create works of art. Holly has written a neural net, ACAN, to augment AI-generated art with values of art composition such as texture, contrast, and color. The “Aikphrasis Project” that she will present in the Sentient Machines? exhibition unites vision and experience across a range of media and practice and ends up as a virtual art show within a real-world A.I. exhibition.

					Mindaugas Gapševičius lives and works in Berlin, Weimar and Vilnius. His work explores the impact of non-human actors on human creativity and the impact of humans on the umwelt. He has completed MA studies at the Vilnius Academy of Arts in 1999 and received a Master of Philosophy degree from the Goldsmiths University of London. He is a creative fellow at the Bauhaus University in Weimar since 2015. Gapševičius was one of the initiators and founders of Institutio Media, the first Lithuanian media art platform (1998), as well as the European Migrating Art Academies network for emerging artists (2008). Along with colleagues from the TOP association, he initiated the first TOP community biolaboratory in Berlin (2016). In 2019 he established Alt lab, a laboratory for non-disciplinary research in Vilnius. Gapševičius’s works have been shown at the Ars Electronica festival in Linz (2019, 2020), the National Gallery of Art and MO Museum in Vilnius (2019), Piksel festival in Bergen (2018), RIXC art and science festival in Riga (2016), Pixelache festival in Helsinki (2015 and 2016), Pixxelpoint festival in Nova Goritsa (2014), KUMU Museum in Tallin (2011). 
					<br><br>
					Maria Safronova Wahlström is an artist based in Gothenburg. With a deep interest in social myths, she is working with themes of collective behaviour and linguistic practices that signal our social belonging. Issues of relations between collective identity and individual formation, our maintenance of social boundaries and moral and ideological branding form the main field of her practice. From a background in classical painting, she moved into the field of sculpture and installation where she seeks juxtapositions of conceptual and visual form, translated through material and space. In different projects she works between small objects, large scale sculptures, graphics and painting.
					<br><br>
					Their project You and I, You and Me presented in Candyland explores the impact of the environment through electricity. How far could electricity help in understanding the other? Is there a possibility to alter human senses by electric impulses? During the participatory event, theaudience is invited to experience the environment, including other humans, by wearing
					jewelry, shoes, and headwear.

					Has a background is in Electronics, Sound and Audiovisual communication. He started his artistic career early on by showing a video performance in the Reina Sofía contemporary art museum in Madrid. From that point on, he continued self-educating about the subjects of Art+ science+ technology. He considers himself lucky to have been around Medialab Madrid, precisely when they started teaching and organizing lectures about media / technology / electronic art. A couple of years later, he moves to Berlin where he does various Artist in residencies. He has lived in Perú, Stockholm, México and California.

					Game designer, film, stage and transmedia director, moving in the inbetweens and unknowns, hacking forced power structures. Inclusion and diversity is at the core of its productions, ranging from computer games linked from its body, to film noir and landscape photography. Isdrake is the founder of Swedens first game and transmedia lab, The Collaboratory, as well as first game art gallery, Epic Unidragon. Their work includes many years of building a better infrastructure for digital culture in Sweden and globally, in dialogue with communities in hacker labs, makerspaces, museums, libraries, the EU Commission, academia and various industries. Currently Isdrake is doing PhD research at Concordia University Tiohtià:ke/Montréal. Portfolio https://isdrake.com/
					<br><br>
					About “Innovation labs and cyborg bodies”
					<br>
					Through a counter tactic perspective, with planetary accountability, Isdrake's work and research prototype diverse human computer interfaces and narratives, aiming to limit bias in the development of new technologies and science (fiction). This includes working with datasets for AI systems, diverse narrative design, testing environment friendly solutions for powering and disposing of used technologies, as well as proposing inclusive interfaces.  At the Futureless Festival Isdrake will talk about their process of building innovation labs in Sweden, how to work with diverse and accessible design, and demo a few of their art works.  The demos will mainly focus on implanted interfaces based on Near Field Communication technology (NFC). Isdrake has a couple of experiences linked from its body, some developed with other organic or inorganic entities. Creating an endosymbiotic relationship between human flesh and other entities, an intimate dialogue only accessible through consent. Games, music and other expressions can be communicated through body modification, a human practice with ancient history, often connected to identity expression but also trauma and oppression. Embodied technologies and digital art as a voice for the silenced voices and disabled bodies, is one of the strongest motivations behind this work.

					Swedish painter who works with artificial intelligence, in a way that dissolves bodies and identities. By painting AI-generated images based on her own body, she takes apart and examines the construction of a self and the (female) body. During the summer of 2021, she trained a neural network, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), with the aim of generating images that she can use as originals for her new works. The neural network was trained using a dataset that consisted of a mix of her previous works and the photos of herself that she would normally use to paint from. This provided a new version of the body she usually depicts. “In my work with artificial intelligence, bodies and identities are dissolved. By painting AI generated images based on my own body I take apart and examine the construction of a self and the (female) body.”

					Swedish programmer and artist living in Berlin and Stockholm. He has exhibited his work in many European countries and is part of the Critical Engineering collective. He will present his work FakeDeeper – Portrait of three critical engineers.
					<br>
					“FakeDeeper demonstrates this in a simple and direct way by allowing a visitor’s face to control the faces of three still images, causing them to move their mouths, pose and make facial expressions like the visitor does in front of the camera in real time. The live situation also allows for strange deformations and glitches and the ability to easily break the illusion in a way that a deliberate fake video production would naturally edit out, but then it also hints at artifacts that can reveal the fake while underscoring how much can be done easily with readily available code, machine learning models, and only still images and a webcam.”

					Is exploring the boundaries of the senses, examining the concepts of interpretation, translation and misrepresentation to reflect on mediated sensations and experiences, while questioning the cultural hegemony of the history of technology and art. “In the 1960s, Peruvian poet Jorge Eduardo Eielson imagined a talking doll that consisted, among other things, of a magnetic tape that stored poetic texts that would allow it to “constantly recite the most beautiful poems that man has conceived.” With the support of Google’s Artists + Machine Intelligence program, I developed what I call AIELSON (a neologism that mixes “A.I.” with “Eielson”) Spoken-Word Poetry Generation System. It is relevant to point out that this album is not a deepfake (fictional audiovisual content created with machine learning tools), as it is not presented as if it were the work of the deceased poet, but as an artificial entity that emulates the poet’s voice as he recites.”

					Multimedia artist, composer, curator and researcher. He studied at the Faculty of Music of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). He has had three solo exhibitions, at the Sound Experimentation Space of the University Museum of Contemporary Museum of Art, at Laboratorio Arte Alameda, and his retrospective exhibition at the Contemporary Art Gallery in Xalapa, Mexico. His work is included in public and private collections. As a multimedia artist, he has participated in several collective exhibitions in several cities in Asia, Europe and America.

					“Memories of oblivion” is a synthesis of an overlay of natural neural networks and artificial neural networks. Several people were asked to model from memory the face of the person they loved most in their life and the process was recorded with a three-dimensional sensor. The resulting three-dimensional objects were fed into a GAN (stylegan2) trained to recognise and produce faces. These abstractions blurred the memory of this artificial intelligence, causing it to forget its learned weights, generating a latent space of affection and tactile memory.”

					Karin Victorin is a creative director, producer, and multi-disciplinary artist based in Stockholm. Her experience reaches from producing and writing scripts for Swedish television and Warner Bros, to three years of being the executive and creative producer of Sweden International Horse Show (Friends Arena), along with creating my own art projects. Between 2006-2011, she was the creative director and founder of the legendary queer burlesque show Hootchy Kootchy Club at Södra Teatern. She has continued to explore new forms of theatre and performance art in the projects Drag as Art, Arise Amazons (Orionteatern 2017), and in my upcoming -art & technology experiment- Chimera Cyborgs.

					Sofia Priftis has been educated in spacial design in Konstfack, University of Arts Crafts and Design, architecture in KTH Royal Institute of Technology, and film in Stockholm University of the Arts she has a broad range of tools. Her interests lay in poetic interruptions of everyday life, with works often driven by social questions about labor, freedom, and the human conditions. Priftis is using play as a method of investigating where our boundaries and desires meet each other.
