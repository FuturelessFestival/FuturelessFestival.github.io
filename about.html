				Futureless Festival (FF) is an Art + Technology event being planned for the 10th to the 14th,
2022, in hybrid format (internationally through our partners) and in various locations in
Stockholm, Sweden.
			</p>
			</br>
			<h1>
				<b>Why Stockholm?</b>
			</h1>
			<p>
				Stockholm City, where this event will take place, has a complex relationship with Media Art:
the 1966 Stockholm festival Visioner av Nuet (translated to Visions of the Present, whose goal
was to examine the impact of Technology on human societies), became one of the first
festivals of its kind worldwide. Almost half a century later, Swedish Artist Anna Lundh
reconsidered this forgotten legacy by organizing the "Visions of the Now" Festival, openly
referencing the previous pioneer festival of ‘66, while wondering about those old visions of the
future and how they changed.
			</p>
			<h1>
				</br>
				<b>What are our visions of the future nowadays, in these times of (climate) crisis?</b>
			</h1>
			
			<p>
				The Futureless Festival, from now on, FF, exerts a critical look onto that idea of the future we
once had and its relation to Technology, one that has shifted drastically particularly due to
climate crisis. In that line, it will reference the previously mentioned historical tradition related
to the Media arts in the Nordic regions from a critical point of view yet placed in a renewed
context where such arts do not seem to have a relevant space in the mainstream of
Stockholm ́s Arts Scene.
			</p>
			</br>
			<h1>
				<b>Why now?</b>
			</h1>
			<p>
				There is currently a renewed interest worldwide for the Electronic and Digital Arts due to the
popularization (and associated controversy) of the NFT (Non-Fungible Tokens) Art, Artificial
Intelligence, and Virtual Reality (the Metaverse). Nevertheless, we can affirm that in the
Nordic Countries, especially in Sweden (where this festival will take place) art shows and
presentations related exclusively to the subject have hit an all-time low, despite being
extremely technology-inclined societies. In that line, the aim of FF is to reference the long
tradition of Art + Tech artists, placing special emphasis in the connection with other similar
festivals such as Piksel festival in Norway and Pixelache in Finland, so to strengthen the Nordic

area’s role within this branch of artistic expression. Now, this year is highly important for
these two Festivals, as they both celebrate their 20th anniversary. This is particularly
meaningful, not only because of the legacy of these two festivals -a long-lasting impact on an
international level- but also, because it exposes even more the need for similar events in
Sweden.
			</p>
			</br>
			<h1>
				
			</h1>
			<p>
				

FF’s activities can be divided into three interconnected axes, which are as follows:
</br>

1. Building a Network of diverse institutions, groups, and Festival organizations connected
with Media/Digital/Electronic/Bio + Tech Arts within the Nordic region. FF will facilitate the
exchange in between these diverse actors, who will have the opportunity to present their
projects on public talks and meetings.
</br>

2. Presenting a series of decentralized Art shows that includes diverse artists from the Nordic
regions and beyond.
</br>

3. Organizing a series of Electronic Sound Art and Art + Tech live Performances
